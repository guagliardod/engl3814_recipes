# Breakfast Cooking Instructions

Welcome to the kitchen! This document is going to guide you through
cooking a few recipes. There will be two recipes for mom and another 2
for Armando. There will be a few other sections for finding common
cooking utensils, spices, and for commonly cooked items.

This guide assumes that you are in the kitchen hand, and you have taken
the time to walk through it and look at everything on the counters.
Before you start any recipes, start with how to find spices instructions
to familiarize yourself with the pantry. There is no need to look at any
of the other steps that are outside recipes unless they are referenced.
